Vagrant VM for deploying Terraform and Ansible - supports Yubikey for SSH authentication
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Impetus for this project ?

- broken python and dependency hell
- share with team members experiencing issues with using their Yubikey for SSH auth

This was tested with Vagrant version 2.0.0 and Virtualbox 5.1.28 on Mac OSX but should work on all platforms

Vagrant file to spin up a VirtualBox virtual machine running Linux (Ubuntu Xenial 16.04 LTS)

pre-installed packages -:

- pip
- python 2.7
- JRE/JDK
- git
- jq
- gnupg-agent
- ansible
- awscli
- terraform
 
Requirements -:
------------

- Hashicorp's Vagrant

https://www.vagrantup.com/

- Oracle VirtualBox   

https://www.virtualbox.org/

Optional -:

Yubikey hardware security token for MFA SSH authentication 

Edit the Vagrantfile to use the vendor and product ID for your particular model of Yubikey

Instructions
------------

1. Install Vagrant and Virtualbox (see official documentation)
2. clone this repo, cd into the directory
3. If you plan on using AWS CLI run start.sh, if not skip to step 4

source start.sh

4. vagrant up
5. vagrant ssh
6. If you need to use Yubikey for SSH authentication run the following command when logged in

eval $(gpg-agent --homedir /home/vagrant/.gnupg --use-standard-socket --daemon)


Troubleshooting -:
---------------

If you find your Yubikey is not working for SSH authentication

- check that your VM is seeing the USB device, unplug and plug the Yubikey back in
- run lsusb to see if the VM is detecting and lists the Yubikey device
- ensure that the Vagrantfile is using the correct vendor and product id for your yubikey
- kill any gpg-agent processes

kill -15 $(ps auxwww|grep gpg-agent | grep -v grep | awk {'print $2'})

- restart the gpg-agent using the eval command above
